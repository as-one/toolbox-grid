## Overview

"CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives." - MDN

"CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system." - CSS Tricks

Despite its capabilities using the grid can be sometimes complex. Defining the grid-template-columns, rows, grid-areas, etc. can be done in several ways and for the newcomers it can be overwhelming which option is most appropriate. This tool has a simple goal: to turn this process easy and fun by allowing a GUI to help the developer in need to create the perfect display while learning more about the styles that are being applied in realtime.
